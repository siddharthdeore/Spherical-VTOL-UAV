# Spherical-VTOL-UAV
Single   Rotor   Vertical   Take-off   and   Landing   system   is   selected   due   to complexity and enthralling factor. Aim of the project is to design an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle which can take off and land vertically with using single propeller in order to provide thrust. Challenge involved in the system is single rotating propeller which is main contributing element to provide lift is making the whole system unstable due to torque  of  power  system.  In  case  of  conventional  helicopter  tail  rotor  is  provided  to balance the torque provided by main rotor power system again multi rotors have even number  ofrotating  propellers  which  rotates  in  such  fashion  cancels  the  net  moment about body. Though there are challenges due to unconventional design, there are certain advantages such as Symmetry of Body in all axis, shape of UAV is spherical thus it can roll  through  obstacles,  delegate  parts  are  enclosed  in  frame  ensuring  safety  of  the system. The main feature of this project is an indigenous design of a flight computer and Ground station.
